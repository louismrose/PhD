\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a structure for a proposed thesis, which will focus on software evolution and its impact on the maintainability of systems, particularly in the context of model-driven engineering. In addition, we restate our research aims, discuss the progress made since submission of a report in January 2009, and provide a revised timetable for the next six months.
