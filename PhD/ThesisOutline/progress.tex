\subsection{Summary}
In this outline, we have presented a structure for the proposed thesis, which will focus on software evolution and its impact on the maintainability of systems, particularly in the context of model-driven engineering. We have discussed the progress made since January, and provided a revised timetable for the next six months. The primary aim of our research during that time will be to address the requirements that we have defined for managing co-evolutionary changes in the context of model-driven engineering.
