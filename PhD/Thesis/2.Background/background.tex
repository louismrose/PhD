\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}

Before reviewing software evolution research, it is first necessary to survey literature from model-driven engineering, which is the engineering approach in which the thesis research is conducted. Section~\ref{sec:mde_terms} introduces the terminology and fundamental principles used in model-driven engineering. Section~\ref{sec:mde_approaches} reviews three approaches for model-driven engineering that are prescribed by MDE practitioners today. Section~\ref{sec:mde_tools} describes contemporary model-driven engineering environments. The related areas of domain-specific languages, language-oriented programming and grammarware are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mde_related}. Finally, the benefits of and current challenges for model-driven engineering are described in Section~\ref{sec:mde_benefits_and_challenges}.
