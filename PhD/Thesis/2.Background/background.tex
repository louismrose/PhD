\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}
This chapter surveys literature from the area in which the thesis research was conducted, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDE is a principled approach to software engineering in which models are produced and consumed throughout the engineering process. Section~\ref{sec:mde_terms} introduces the terminology and fundamental principles used in MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_methods} reviews guidance and three methods for performing MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_tools} describes contemporary MDE environments. Two areas of research relating to MDE, domain-specific languages and language-oriented programming, are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mde_related}. Finally, the benefits of and current challenges for MDE are described in Section~\ref{sec:mde_benefits_and_challenges}.

\section{Chapter Summary}
This chapter has discussed Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), a state-of-the-art and principled approach to software engineering. The terminology, development activities and tools used in a typical MDE process were introduced. Two areas relating to MDE, language-oriented programming and domain-specific languages, were discussed, and three methods for performing MDE were reviewed.

Traditional approaches to software engineering do not treat modelling artefacts -- such as model, metamodels and model management operations -- as first-class citizens, and they are typically represented in an unstructured manner, if at all. MDE involves creating, manipulating and managing changes to modelling artefacts and therefore modelling artefacts are represented in a structured manner. This chapter has demonstrated that contemporary MDE tools, such as EMF and Epsilon, provide structures and processes for creating and manipulating modelling artefacts, but not for managing evolutionary change. Chapters~\ref{LiteratureReview} and~\ref{Analysis} review, explore and investigate structures and processes for managing the evolution of modelling artefacts.
