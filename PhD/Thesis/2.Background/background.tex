\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}

Before reviewing software evolution research, it is first necessary to survey literature from model-driven engineering (MDE), which is the context in which the thesis research was conducted. Section~\ref{sec:mde_terms} introduces the terminology and fundamental principles used in MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_methods} reviews guidance and three methods for performing MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_tools} describes contemporary MDE environments. The related areas of domain-specific languages and language-oriented programming are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mde_related}. Finally, the benefits of and current challenges for MDE are described in Section~\ref{sec:mde_benefits_and_challenges}.
