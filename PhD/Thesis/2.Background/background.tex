\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}
This chapter surveys literature from the area in which the thesis research was conducted, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDE is a principled approach to software engineering in which models are produced throughout the engineering process. Section~\ref{sec:mde_terms} introduces the terminology and fundamental principles used in MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_methods} reviews guidance and three methods for performing MDE. Section~\ref{sec:mde_tools} describes contemporary MDE environments. Two areas of research relating to MDE, domain-specific languages and language-oriented programming, are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mde_related}. Finally, the benefits of and current challenges for MDE are described in Section~\ref{sec:mde_benefits_and_challenges}.
