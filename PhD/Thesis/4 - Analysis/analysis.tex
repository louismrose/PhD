\chapter{Analysis}
%The literature review will motivate a deeper analysis of existing techniques for managing evolution in the context of MDE. The benefits and drawbacks of existing techniques will be highlighted by applying them to data from projects using MDE. The analysis will be used to identify requirements for our research.

\section{Locating Data}
% The first section of the analysis chapter will be based on a section of the progress report, which discusses the data (existing MDE projects) used to analysis existing techniques for managing evolution in the context of MDE. We will introduce and explain the requirements on the data to be used for analysis, identify candidate MDE projects, describe the selection process, and provide reasons for our choices.

\section{Analysing Existing Techniques}
% Having described the selection of suitable data for the analysis, we will then outline the way in which we have applied existing techniques to the data, and introduce criteria against which the effectiveness of existing techniques will be measured. 


\section{Requirements Identification}
% The analysis of existing techniques will lead to requirements for our research. We will conclude the chapter by enumerating these requirements, refining the high-level research objectives from the literature review chapter into lower-level research objectives.
