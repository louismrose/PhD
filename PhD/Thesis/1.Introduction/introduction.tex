\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Model-Driven Engineering}
%The proposed thesis will begin by discussing the challenges that MDE addresses. Terminology relevant to MDE will be introduced (including terms such as \emph{model}, \emph{metamodel} and \emph{model transformation}). The benefits of MDE will be discussed along with the main threats to its adoption, which include challenges for controlling and managing software evolution with MDE \cite{mens07softwareevolution}.

\section{Software Evolution}
%The introduction will then discuss software evolution, and its causes. The challenges presented by software evolution will be highlighted, particularly in the context of MDE, and used to motivate the proposed thesis.

\section{Research Aim}
%The high-level aim of the research will be stated, providing a context for the background and literature review chapters. 

\section{Research Method}
%This section will discuss the way in which the research was conducted, including a description of the evaluation strategy.
