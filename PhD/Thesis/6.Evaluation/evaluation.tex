\section{Summary}
-- Summarise chapter.

In addition to the evaluation described in this chapter, the work presented in this thesis has been subjected to peer review by the academic and Eclipse communities. The thesis research has been published in papers at XX workshops, YY European conferences and ZZ international conferences. HUTN, Flock and Concordance (Chapter~\ref{Implementation}) are part of the Epsilon project, a member of the research incubator for the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP), which is arguably the most active MDE community at present. EMP's research incubator hosts a limited number of participants, selected through a rigorous process and contributions made to the incubator undergo regular technical review.
