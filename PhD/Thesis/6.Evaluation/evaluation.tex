\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{Evaluation}
This chapter evaluates the structures and processes proposed in this thesis with respect to the research hypothesis outlined in Section~\ref{sec:hypothesis}. In particular, the evaluation explores the extent to which the structures and processes affect developer productivity and the understandability of software. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{Introduction}, 
these two characteristics are key to the success of the large and complicated software engineering projects demanded by society today. Given the time constraints of a doctoral thesis, the proposed structures and processes are prototypes, and unlikely to be fit for industrial use in their current state. The evaluation aims to determine areas in which the proposed structures and processes might be usefully improved by identifying factors that affect the efficacy of the structures and processes. The conclusions drawn in this chapter identify benefits and drawbacks of using the proposed structures and processes for managing co-evolution in contemporary MDE development environments and for industrial software-engineering projects\footnote{TODO: discuss this in chapter summary}.j

Chapter~\ref{Analysis} identified \emph{user-driven co-evolution}, a process for managing co-evolution, that had been used in real-world MDE projects and that had not been recognised in the literature. Chapter~\ref{Implementation} described the implementation of two structures tailored for user-driven co-evolution, a \emph{metamodel-independent syntax} and a \emph{textual modelling notation}. Using a real-world example of user-driven co-evolution, Section~\ref{sec:exemplar_user-driven_co-evo} assesses the extent to which the dedicated structures proposed in Chapter~\ref{Implementation} affect the productivity of user-driven co-evolution.

The remainder of the chapter evaluates developer-driven co-evolution (in which a migration strategy is specified in an executable format) and focuses on \emph{Epsilon Flock} (Section~\ref{sec:flock}), a transformation language tailored for model migration. Section~\ref{sec:quantitive} evaluates the novel source-target relationship strategy implemented in Flock, \emph{conservative copy}, by comparison with two existing source-target relationship strategies using co-evolution examples from real-world projects. Sections~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison} and~\ref{sec:ttc} evaluate Flock as a whole, using an expert evaluation and a transformation contest, respectively. The transformation contest was judged by members of the MDE community, providing an opportunity for Flock and other transformation tools to be assessed in a peer review.

The work presented in this chapter has been published in \cite{rose10comparison,rose10ttc_solution,rose10ttc_case}. The evaluation described in Sections~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison} and \ref{sec:ttc} was performed collaboratively, and the contributions of others are highlighted in those sections.

\section{Chapter Summary}
To be completed, but will include a paragraph similar to the following:

In addition to the evaluation described in this chapter, the work presented in this thesis has been subjected to peer review by the academic and Eclipse communities. The thesis research has been published in papers at XX workshops, YY European conferences and ZZ international conferences. HUTN, Flock and Concordance (Chapter~\ref{Implementation}) are part of the Epsilon project, a member of the research incubator for the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP), which is arguably the most active MDE community at present. EMP's research incubator hosts a limited number of participants, selected through a rigorous process and contributions made to the incubator undergo regular technical review.
