\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{Evaluation}
Chapter~\ref{Implementation} outlined requirements for and described the implementation of a textual modelling notation and a model migration language. This chapter describes the way in which both solutions were evaluated against their requirements, and against the thesis requirements identified in Chapter~\ref{Analysis}. A further solution, the metamodel-independent syntax, was developed in Section~\ref{sec:mmi_syntax} and is not evaluated explicitly in this chapter, as discussed below. 

The textual modelling notation (Section~\ref{sec:notation}) was developed to address the challenges faced when performing user-driven co-evolution. Using a real-world example of user-driven co-evolution, Section~\ref{sec:exemplar_user-driven_co-evo} demonstrates an existing and a novel process for performing manual migration, and indicates the benefits of using the textual modelling notation in the novel process. 

A transformation language tailored for model migration, Epsilon Flock (Section~\ref{sec:flock}), was developed to allow the specification and execution of model migration strategies. Flock uses a novel algorithm for relating source to target model elements, termed conservative copy. Conservative copy is evaluated against the two existing mechanisms for relating source and target model elements in Section~\ref{sec:quantitive} using quantitive measurements. Epsilon Flock has been evaluated by comparison to other migration tools (Section~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison}) and to other transformation languages (Section~\ref{sec:ttc}). The developers of other tools have been involved in the evaluation described in Sections~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison} and \ref{sec:ttc}, and their contributions are highlighted. The work presented in this chapter has been published in \cite{rose10comparison,rose10ttc_case,rose10ttc_solution}.

\paragraph{Evaluation of the Metamodel-Indepenent Syntax} The metamodel-independent syntax was developed to address the following thesis requirement, identified in Section~\ref{sec:requirements_identification}: \emph{This thesis must investigate the extension of existing modelling frameworks to support the loading of non-conformant models and conformance checking of models against other metamodels.}

The metamodel-independent syntax was demonstrated to facilitate loading of non-conformant models and conformance checking in Section~\ref{subsec:mmi_syntax_example}. Additionally, the metamodel-independent syntax was used in the implementation of the textual modelling notation, which was evaluated as described in Section~\ref{sec:exemplar_user-driven_co-evo}. As such, no further evaluation of the metamodel-independent syntax is presented in this chapter. Instead, the remainder of the chapter focuses on the evaluation of the textual modelling notation and the model migration language.

\section{Summary}
To be completed.

In addition to the evaluation described in this chapter, the work presented in this thesis has been subjected to peer review by the academic and Eclipse communities. The thesis research has been published in papers at XX workshops, YY European conferences and ZZ international conferences. HUTN, Flock and Concordance (Chapter~\ref{Implementation}) are part of the Epsilon project, a member of the research incubator for the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP), which is arguably the most active MDE community at present. EMP's research incubator hosts a limited number of participants, selected through a rigorous process and contributions made to the incubator undergo regular technical review.
