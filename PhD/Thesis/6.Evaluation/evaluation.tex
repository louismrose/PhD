\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{Evaluation}

%The evaluation chapter will outline our evaluation method and results, including the impact and limitations of our research; and discuss the extent to which the requirements identified in the analysis chapter have been fulfilled. Evaluation will be conducted in three ways: application of our structures and processes in a case study; publication of our research in academic journals, international conferences and workshops; and assessing the contribution made when delivering our work through an Eclipse research incubation project.

\section{Discussion}
% We will discuss the limitations of our work, using for context the feedback of users, reviews of publications and scenarios from the case study discussed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:case_study}

\subsection{Threats to validity}



\section{Dissemination / Reception / ??}

\subsection{Publications}
% Publication in academic journals, and at international conferences and workshops ensure that our work is reviewed by experts, and is well-established and communicated in our field of research. So far, I have been the primary author for publications at one international conference (\cite{rose08hutn}), one European conference (\cite{rose08egl}), and one workshop (\cite{rose09patterns}). The first was published at MoDELS/UML, the leading international conference on model-driven engineering, in a year when it had a record number of submissions (274, 20\% acceptance), and has been nominated by HISE for the annual departmental award for best paper by a research student.

% We will submit our work to software evolution conferences, as well as at model-driven engineering conferences. Doing so will allow us to assess the impact of our research for a broader audience.


\subsection{Delivery through Eclipse}
% The tools produced as part of our research have been and will continue to be released as part of the Epsilon project, a member of the research incubator for the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP), arguably the most active MDE community at present. EMP's research incubator hosts a limited number of participants, selected through a rigorous process. Contributions made to the incubator undergo regular technical review.

% Contributing to Epsilon allows us to deliver our research to the growing community \cite{kolovos08thesis} of Epsilon users.
