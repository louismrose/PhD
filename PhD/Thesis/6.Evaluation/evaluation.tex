\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{Evaluation}
This chapter explores the extent to which the structures and processes proposed in this thesis are beneficial in terms of increased developer productivity and understandability of software in the context of MDE. The co-evolution process identified in Chapter~\ref{Analysis} and the dedicated structures for managing co-evolution described in Chapter~\ref{Implementation} are evaluated by comparison to other processes and structures and application to real-world examples. Appendices~\ref{ProcessOriented} and~\ref{CoevolutionExamples} describe the co-evolution examples used for evaluation, which are distinct from those used for analysis in Chapter~\ref{Analysis}.

Chapter~\ref{Analysis} identified \emph{user-driven co-evolution}, a process for managing co-evolution that had been used in real-world MDE projects, but had not been recognised in the literature. Chapter~\ref{Implementation} described the implementation of two structures tailored for user-driven co-evolution, a \emph{metamodel-independent syntax} and a \emph{textual modelling notation}. Using a real-world example of user-driven co-evolution, Section~\ref{sec:exemplar_user-driven_co-evo} assesses the extent to which the dedicated structures proposed in Chapter~\ref{Implementation} affect the productivity of user-driven co-evolution.

The remainder of the chapter evaluates developer-driven co-evolution (in which a migration strategy is specified in an executable format) and focuses on \emph{Epsilon Flock} (Section~\ref{sec:flock}), a transformation language tailored for model migration. Section~\ref{sec:quantitive} evaluates the novel source-target relationship strategy implemented in Flock, \emph{conservative copy}, by comparison to two existing source-target relationship strategies using co-evolution examples from real-world projects. Sections~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison} and~\ref{sec:ttc} evaluate Flock as a whole, using an expert evaluation and a transformation contest, respectively.

The work presented in this chapter has been published in \cite{rose10comparison,rose10ttc_solution,rose10ttc_case}. The evaluation described in Sections~\ref{sec:collaborative_comparison} and \ref{sec:ttc} was performed collaboratively, and the contributions of others are highlighted in those sections.

\section{Chapter Summary}
To be completed, but will include a paragraph similar to the following:

In addition to the evaluation described in this chapter, the work presented in this thesis has been subjected to peer review by the academic and Eclipse communities. The thesis research has been published in papers at XX workshops, YY European conferences and ZZ international conferences. HUTN, Flock and Concordance (Chapter~\ref{Implementation}) are part of the Epsilon project, a member of the research incubator for the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP), which is arguably the most active MDE community at present. EMP's research incubator hosts a limited number of participants, selected through a rigorous process and contributions made to the incubator undergo regular technical review.
