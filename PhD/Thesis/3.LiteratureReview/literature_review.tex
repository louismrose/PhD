\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{LiteratureReview}
%The literature review chapter will provide a thorough review and critical analysis of software evolution research. We will compare and contrast existing techniques for managing and automating activities relating to software evolution. As well as reviewing techniques that apply to the specific challenges caused by software evolution in the context of MDE, we will also critique literature from related areas, such as database and XML schema evolution; and program and modelling language evolution. This chapter will conclude by providing high-level research objectives in the context of the reviewed literature.
