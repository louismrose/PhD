\chapter{Implementation}
\label{Implementation}
Section~\ref{sec:requirements_identification} presented requirements for structures and processes for identifying and managing co-evolution. This chapter describes the way in which the requirements have been approached. Several related structures were implemented, using domain-specific languages, metamodelling and model management operations. Figure~\ref{fig:implementation_overview} summarises the contents of the chapter. To facilitate the management of non-conformant models with existing modelling frameworks, a metamodel-independent syntax was devised and implemented (Section~\ref{sec:mmi_syntax}). To address some of the challenges faced in user-driven co-evolution, an OMG specification for a textual modelling notation was implemented (Section~\ref{sec:notation}). To determine their merits and drawbacks, existing languages for specifying model migration were identified, analysed and compared (Section~\ref{sec:analyis_of_languages_used_for_migration}). Finally, a new model transformation language -- tailored for model migration and centred around a novel approach to relating source and target model elements -- was designed and implemented (Section~\ref{sec:flock}).

\section{Chapter Summary}
The structures described in this chapter have been released as part of Epsilon in the Eclipse GMT \cite{gmt} project, which is the research incubator of arguably the most widely used MDE modelling framework, EMF. By re-using parts of Epsilon, implementations of the solutions were produced more rapidly than if the tools were developed independently. In particular, re-using the Epsilon model connectivity layer facilitated interoperability of Flock with several MDE modelling frameworks, which was exploited to manage a practical case of model migration in Section~\ref{sec:ttc}.
