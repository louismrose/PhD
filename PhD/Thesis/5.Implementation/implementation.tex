\chapter{Implementation}
\label{Implementation}
Section~\ref{sec:requirements_identification} identified requirements for structures and processes for managing co-evolution. In this chapter, the way in which this thesis approaches those requirements is described. Several related solutions were implemented, using domain-specific languages, automation and extensions to existing modelling technologies. Figure~\ref{fig:implementation_overview} summarises the structure of the chapter. To better support co-evolution and to overcome restrictions with existing modelling frameworks, a metamodel-independent syntax was devised and implemented, enabling model and metamodel decoupling and consistency checking (Section~\ref{sec:mmi_syntax}). To address some of the challenges faced in user-driven co-evolution, an OMG specification for an alternative, textual modelling notation was implemented (Section~\ref{sec:notation}). Model migration languages were identified, analysed and compared, leading to the derivation and implementation of a new model transformation language tailored for model migration and centred around a novel approach to relating source and target model elements (Section~\ref{sec:flock}).

\section{Chapter Summary}

The solutions described in this chapter have been released as part of Epsilon in the Eclipse GMT \cite{gmt} project, which is the research incubator of arguably the most widely used MDE modelling framework, EMF. By re-using parts of Epsilon, implementations of the solutions were produced more rapidly than if the tools were developed from scratch. In particular, re-using the Epsilon model connectivity layer facilitated interoperability of Flock with several MDE modelling frameworks, which was exploited to manage a practical case of model migration in Section~\ref{sec:ttc}.
