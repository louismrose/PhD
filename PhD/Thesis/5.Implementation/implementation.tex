\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{Implementation}
Section~\ref{sec:requirements_identification} presented requirements for structures and processes for identifying and managing co-evolution. This chapter describes the way in which the requirements have been addressed. Several related structures have been implemented, using domain-specific languages, metamodelling and model management operations. Figure~\ref{fig:implementation_overview} summarises the contents of the chapter. To facilitate the management of non-conformant models with existing modelling frameworks, a metamodel-independent syntax was devised and implemented (Section~\ref{sec:mmi_syntax}). To address some of the challenges faced in user-driven co-evolution, an OMG specification for a textual modelling notation was implemented (Section~\ref{sec:notation}). Finally, a model transformation language -- tailored for model migration and centred around a novel approach to relating source and target model elements -- was designed and implemented (Sections~\ref{sec:analyis_of_languages_used_for_migration} and~\ref{sec:flock}).

The structures presented in this chapter are interoperable as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation_structure}. In particular, the modelling framework extensions provided by the metamodel-independent syntax are used to provide conformance checking for the textual modelling notation, and to enable partial migration for the model migration language. The structures were separated to facilitate re-use of the conformance checking services provided by the metamodel-independent syntax. Table~\ref{tab:implementation_to_requirements} shows the relationship between the proposed structures and the thesis requirements (Section~\ref{sec:requirements_identification}).

\section{Chapter Summary}
Three structures for identifying and managing co-evolution have been designed and implemented to approach the thesis requirements outlined in Chapter~\ref{Analysis}. The way in which modelling frameworks implicitly enforce conformance makes managing non-conformant models challenging, and the proposed metamodel-independent syntax (Section~\ref{sec:mmi_syntax}) extends modelling frameworks to facilitate the management of non-conformant models. The proposed textual modelling notation, Epsilon HUTN (Section~\ref{sec:notation}), provides a human-usable notation as an alternative to XMI for performing user-driven co-evolution. Finally, Epsilon Flock (Section~\ref{sec:flock}) contributes a domain-specific language for describing model migration.

The metamodel-independent syntax is a modelling framework extension that makes explicit the conformance relationship between models and metamodels. By binding models not to their metamodel but to a generic metamodel, the metamodel-independent syntax allows non-conformant models to be managed with modelling tools and model management operations. Furthermore, conformance checking is provided as a service, which can be scheduled at any time, and not just when models are loaded. The metamodel-independent syntax has been integrated with Concordance \cite{rose10concordance} to provide a metamodel installation process that automatically reports conformance problems, and underpins the implementation of the second structure described in this chapter, a textual modelling notation.

For performing user-driven co-evolution, the textual modelling notation described in Section~\ref{sec:notation} provides an alternative to XMI. Unlike XMI, the notation introduced in this chapter implements the OMG standard for Human-Usable Textual Notation (HUTN) \cite{hutn} and is optimised for human usability. Epsilon HUTN, introduced here, is presently the sole reference implementation of HUTN. Constructing Epsilon HUTN atop the metamodel-independent syntax allows Epsilon HUTN to provide incremental and background conformance checking, and an XMI-to-HUTN transformation for loading non-conformant models. Section~\ref{sec:exemplar_user-driven_co-evo} explores the benefits and drawbacks of using the metamodel-independent syntax and Epsilon HUTN together to perform user-driven co-evolution.

The domain-specific language described in Section~\ref{sec:flock}, Epsilon Flock, combines several concepts from existing model-to-model transformation languages to form a language tailored to model migration. In particular, Flock contributes a novel mechanism for relating source and target model elements termed conservative copy, which is a hybrid of new- and existing-target styles of model-to-model transformation. Flock is built atop Epsilon and hence interoperates transparently with several modelling technologies via the Epsilon Model Connectivity layer. 

The metamodel-independent syntax, Epsilon HUTN, Epsilon Flock and Concordance have been released as part of Epsilon in the Eclipse GMT\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/gmt}} project, which is the research incubator of arguably the most widely used MDE modelling framework, EMF. By re-using parts of Epsilon, the structures were implemented more rapidly than would have been possible when developing the structures independently. In particular, re-using the Epsilon Model Connectivity layer facilitated interoperability of Flock with several MDE modelling frameworks, which was exploited to manage a practical case of model migration in Section~\ref{sec:ttc}.
