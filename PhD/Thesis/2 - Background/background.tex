\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}

%The background chapter will serve two purposes: firstly, to introduce areas of computer science that are related to our research, and secondly to introduce two categories of evolution observed in model-driven engineering. These two categories were described in the progress report.

\section{Related Areas}
%Several subsections will be used, one per related area. Topics are likely to include domain-specific languages and language-oriented programming; refactoring and design patterns; and iterative and incremental approaches to software engineering. We will discuss the applicability and relationship of each area to software evolution in the context of model-driven engineering.

\section{Categories of Evolution in MDE}
%This section will discuss model and metamodel co-evolution and model synchronisation, two categories of evolution observed in MDE. These categories were introduced in Section~\ref{sec:introduction} of this thesis outline.
