To be completed.
%\textit{Model-Driven Engineering} (MDE) is the term given to development processes that systematically employ models as first-class citizens for constructing and maintaining software systems. Ways in which MDE is reported to improve the development of large-scale software systems are discussed. Realisation of the promised benefits of model-driven engineering can be inhibited by the change (also termed \textit{evolution}) of development artefacts. Identifying, analysing and mitigating the effects of evolution on MDE remain open research challenges. Some of the ways in which evolution may affect a model-driven process are discussed here, along with a review of software evolution research in other domains. A plan for categorising and describing evolution that occurs during MDE is proposed. Using this plan, contributions that seek to minimise the impact of evolution on MDE are identified.
