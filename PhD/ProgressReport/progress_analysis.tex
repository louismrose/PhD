\subsection{Analysis of Existing Techniques}
\label{sub:analysis_of_existing_techniques}


\subsubsection{Model and Metamodel Co-Evolution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce COPE and Cicchetti's work. I found them in the lit review discussed in Section \ref{sub:elaboration}. Mention that the literature did not demonstrate the use of the tools on real-world examples. 
	\item Explain my process for analysing these tools.
	\item Discuss the current status of my analysis.
\end{itemize}

    Analysed the most promising tools using data from a real-world system.

    Presented HUTN at MoDELs. At the same conference, a tool (called COPE) for managing model and metamodel co-evolution was presented. COPE makes use of a generic syntax for performing model migration and metamodel evolution.
