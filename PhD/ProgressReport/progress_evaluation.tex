\subsection{Analysis of Existing Techniques}
\label{sub:analysis_of_existing_techniques}


\subsubsection{Model and Metamodel Co-Evolution}
    Analysed the most promising tools using data from a real-world system.

    Presented HUTN at MoDELs. At the same conference, a tool (called COPE) for managing model and metamodel co-evolution was presented. COPE makes use of a generic syntax for performing model migration and metamodel evolution.



\subsection{Development}
\label{sub:development}
		    Begun cataloguing types of model evolution. Started with Fowler's refactorings, and now expanding to incorporate evolutions seen in real-world systems.
