\section{Progress}
Since submitting my qualifying dissertation, I have made progress in three areas. Firstly, I have conducted a thorough review of literature in the areas of co-evolution and synchronisation, enabling elaboration of the aims of my research. Secondly, I have located and analysed example data of evolutionary changes occurring during MDE. Thirdly, I have begun to evaluate existing techniques for managing evolutionary change in MDE. In this section, the progress made in each of these areas is discussed in turn.

In my qualifying dissertation, the term \emph{case study} was used to describe an existing MDE project containing examples of evolution. In this report, the term \emph{example} is preferred.
