\section{Progress}
Since submitting my qualifying dissertation, I have made progress in four areas. Firstly, I have conducted a thorough review of literature in the areas of co-evolution and synchronisation, enabling elaboration of the aims of my research. Secondly, I have located examples of evolutionary changes occurring during MDE. Thirdly, I have used the examples to evaluate existing techniques for managing evolutionary change in MDE. Fourthly, I have begun to develop a language for specifying evolution. In this section, the progress made in each of these areas is discussed in turn.

In my qualifying dissertation, the term \emph{case study} was used to describe an existing MDE project containing examples of evolution. In this report, the term \emph{example} is preferred.
