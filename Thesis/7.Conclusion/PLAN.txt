Tim Kelly's thesis:
* Short paragraph summarising contribution, which then divides contribution into three areas:
** definition & eval of a method for GSN
** definition & eval of process for maintaining a safety argument
** definition & eval of means for re-using successful safety arguments

* Section on each of these contribution
** short comparison to alternatives in the literature
** highlights trade-offs between approaches
** highlight novelties of work

* Overalls conclusions
** Summarise contributions and ethos of thesis.
** Relate to overall goals of area. For example: "the presentation of a clear, comprehensive and compelling safety argument remains the prime objective of any safety case. It is for this reason that this thesis can claim to have addressed issues that are at the heart of safety case management process."

* Further work

* Coda
** Outlook for thesis research in the future (interest, application to examples, future collaboration, etc)


David Pumfrey's thesis:

* Substantiation of the thesis proposition
** Restates the thesis hypothesis and aims
** Discusses extent to which work supports hypothesis, highlighting a (partial) contradiction

* Concluding remarks
** Relates work back to field by highlighting the importance of safety engineering.
** Refers to a well-known paper in the area.

* Further work


Zoe's thesis:
* Enumerates key issues (e.g. some types of dependency not reflected in the interfaces within software and hence the accuracy of change impact analysis is reduced, for safety-critical software techniques that facilitate flexibility in software engineering cannot be used, changes typically affect many parts of the software)
* Restates thesis hypothesis

* Summarises findings of three major chapters, for example: review findings
** Focus is on engineering single software products, not related families.
** Traceability is integral to SE, but does not typically include links to contexts considered useful in embedded software domain.
** No impact analysis techniques are designed for families of products
** Motivate need for modelling contextual information, and highlight why existing work cannot be used for family models

* Further work


Rob's thesis:

* Summarises contributions
** Identifies key challenges for SoS hazard analysis, condensing them into a set of explicit requirements
** Provides a systematic method for building multi-agent simulations for SoS
** Defines a hazard analysis method that extracts and explains cause of accidents

* Discusses contributions in each of the three core areas above



Dimitris's thesis:
* Enumerates key issues (e.g. MDE process involves many types of model management operation, each type of operation has individual requirements and hence is best addressed with task-specific languages, re-use, workflows)
* Restates thesis hypothesis and objectives

* Findings of background and literature review
** Identified types of model management operation
** Reviewed existing languages and tools for their specification
** Motivated need for task-specific and interoperable languages (e.g. duplication, inconsistency between languages)

* Summary of contributions
** Implementation: model connectivity layer, object language, task specific languages, workflow layer, etc
** Summary of evaluation: case study, re-use

* Future work
** Performance & scalability
